# Javascript-Quiz

For this homework we were tasked with creating a Code Quiz by using javascript. The criteria for the quiz were as follows:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

The bulk of the homework was done through javascript, as it allowed the quiz to start, make questions appear one after the other, allowed for a timer to be introduced, to collect user data and store it in the local storage and many more uses.

Below is an image to show what the highscore tab would show. A button to go back to the start and one to clear the highscore table.

Although I managed to meet some of the criteria, this homework was especially long winded and difficult and I was unable to complete it. However, I now know where my weaknesses lie and will surely address them.
